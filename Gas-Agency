Project Title: Career Guidance
Problem Statement
The Career Guidance web application is designed to help students and parents find detailed information about institutions, including tuition fees, eligibility criteria, placement options, housing facilities, and more. It supports students in choosing engineering and management universities in India and abroad by generating a personalized college list based on entrance exam results and eligibility criteria. Students can also narrow their options based on ranking, fee constraints, and location preferences. The system incorporates an aptitude test to assess studentsâ€™ suitability and provide tailored recommendations.
